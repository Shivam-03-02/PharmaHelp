The provided code implements a blockchain-based pharmaceutical supply chain management system with multiple roles, including Admin, Supplier, Manufacturer, Distributor, Retailer, and Transporter. Here is a summary of its key components and functionalities:

Admin Contract:
- Manages user roles and permissions.
- Stores user information and allows role registration, revocation, and reassignment.

Supplier Contract:
- Allows suppliers to create raw material packages.
- Maintains a record of previously created raw materials.
- Permits only users with the "Supplier" role to create packages.

Manufacturer Contract:
- Enables manufacturers to use raw materials to create medicines.
- Registers new medicines and exports them to distributors.
- Tracks existing medicines and received raw materials.

Distributor Contract:
- Facilitates the receipt of medicines from manufacturers and distribution to retailers.
- Keeps a record of distributed medicines.
- Allows retailers to update medicine statuses (e.g., At Retailer, Sold, Expire, Damaged).

Retailer Contract:
- Involves retailers in receiving medicines from distributors and selling them.
- Provides functionality to update medicine statuses.
- Maintains the status of medicines.

Transporter Contract:
- Manages the transportation of medicines between different entities.
- Allows transporters to load consignments based on their type (raw materials, medicines, retailer shipments).

Common Elements:
- Uses a shared Roles enum to manage user roles across contracts.
- Utilizes events to log important contract activities.
- Contracts accept an address of the admin contract during deployment to ensure centralized role and permission management.
- Employs modifiers and mappings for data storage and access.
- Defines specific functions for each contract role.

In essence, this code establishes a secure and transparent supply chain system for pharmaceuticals,
leveraging blockchain technology to monitor the movement of medicines from suppliers to consumers 
while enforcing strict role-based access control and data tracking.
